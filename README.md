# Housing-Market-Price-Prediction
Predicting Future House Prices.

Project OverviewÂ¶


In this project, we'll predict future house prices. We'll use economy data from the U.S Federal Reserve, along with house price data from Zillow. We'll merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model. The model will predict if house prices will increase or decrease in the future.

We'll measure error using backtesting, then improve our model with new predictors.

Objective: prediction of future house price changes in New york, United States
